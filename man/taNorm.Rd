\title{Total Area Normalisation}
\usage{
taNorm(X, noi)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numerical matrix with rows being the spectra and columns being the chemical shift variables}

\item{noi}{Takes an array that is row matched to the X matrix you are normalising with the values equaling the maximum noise estimation for each spectra respectively.}
}
\value{
A list of
\enumerate{
\item The normalised X matrix in the first list element, and
\item A numerical array of the corresponding dilution factors.
}
\itemize{
\item Following the example below will extract the results quickly and easily.
}
}
\description{
Total area normalisation (TA) scales spectra so that they all have a total integral of one
}
\details{
\subsection{How It Works:}{
\enumerate{
\item The integral of each experimental spectra in X is calculated
\item Each intensity of a spectrum is divided by it's integral which reduces it's total area to one
}
}

\subsection{Background Information:}{
\itemize{
\item TA was once considered the gold standard in NMR spectra normalisation.
\item TA is also referred to as constant sum or integral normalisation
\item TA is useful for spectra that have similar peaks.
}
}

\subsection{Advantages:}{
\itemize{
\item TA is a straightforward normalisation method with limited computational requirements making it quick and uncomplicated.
\item Combining both TA and another normalisation method could also provide more robust results.
}
}

\subsection{Limitations:}{
\itemize{
\item Large variation in the peaks present in a spectra severly impact TA's performance.
\item For instance, some spectra have large peaks created by drug metabolites, etc., which increase the total area of the spectrum.
\item This large total area will then dramatically down scale spectra and give misleading results.
