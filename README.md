# unorm
This is an R package that contains functions able to normalise nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic spectra. This package is particularly applicable to urine spectra that typically have large dilution variations which can significantly alter the signal intensities of peaks. This package contains key normalisation techniques required for proper preprocessing of spectra to produce more accurate and robust results from the statistical analysis of NMR spectra.
## Included Normalisation Techniques
- Total Area (a.k.a. Constant Sum or Integral) Normalisation **(TAN)**
- Creatinine Normalisation **(CN)**
- Probabilistic Quotient Normalisation **(PQN)**
- Histogram Matching **(HM)**
- Quantile Normalisation **(QN)**
