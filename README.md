# unorm
This is an R package that contains functions able to normalise nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic spectra.  <br>
This package is particularly applicable to urine spectra that typically have large dilution variations which can significantly alter the signal intensities of peaks.  <br>
This package contains key **normalisation techniques** required for proper preprocessing of spectra to produce more accurate and robust results from the statistical analysis of NMR spectra.  <br>
This package also contains a function that fully preprocesses urine spectra for streamlined data analysis
## Included Normalisation Techniques
- Total Area (a.k.a. Constant Sum or Integral) Normalisation **(TAN)**
- Creatinine Normalisation **(CN)**
- Probabilistic Quotient Normalisation **(PQN)**
- Histogram Matching **(HM)**
- Region of Interest Normalisation **(RIN)**
