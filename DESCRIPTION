Description: unorm is a package designed to normalise nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrospy spectra through a variety of methods.
  This package could be useful to anyone working with urine data derived from samples with dilution variations and contains a number of commonly used functions such as PQN and Total Area (a.k.a. Constant Sum or Integral) Normalisation.
  This package also contains a preprocessing function that streamlines baseline correction, non-quantative region removal, spectral calibration and orientation, and linewidth checking using the power of Metabom8.
