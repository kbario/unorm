Title: Contains functions able to preprocess and normalise 1D NMR spectra
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Kyle Bario and Torben Kimhofer
Maintainer: Kyle Bario <kylebario1@gmail.com>
Description: this package contains functions that are able to normalise and preprocess 1D NMR spectra.
    the preprocessing will ensure that the spectra are correctly orientated, calibrated (default = tsp), nonquantative regions are removed, and baseline corrected, while also returning a information about the linewidth of the peaks.
    the normalisation methods used are Total Area/Constant Sum Normalisation, Probabilistic Quotient Normalisation (PQN), Normalisation based on an External Factor, Region of Interest (ROI) Normalisation, Quantile Normalisation, Histogram Matching and Multiplicative Scatter Correction Normalisation.

Description: unorm is a package designed to normalise nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrospy spectra through a variety of methods.
  This package could be useful to anyone working with urine data derived from samples with dilution variations and contains a number of commonly used functions such as PQN and Total Area (a.k.a. Constant Sum or Integral) Normalisation.
