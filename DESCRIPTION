Description: this package contains functions that are able to normalise and preprocess 1D NMR spectra.
    the preprocessing will ensure that the spectra are correctly orientated, calibrated (default = tsp), nonquantative regions are removed, and baseline corrected, while also returning a information about the linewidth of the peaks.
    the normalisation methods used are Total Area/Constant Sum Normalisation, Probabilistic Quotient Normalisation (PQN), Normalisation based on an External Factor, Region of Interest (ROI) Normalisation, Quantile Normalisation, Histogram Matching and Multiplicative Scatter Correction Normalisation.
